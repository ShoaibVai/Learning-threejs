      "content": "# Understanding Localhost\n\nWhen you run a server on your computer, it typically listens on a **network interface**. The most common is:\n\n- **localhost (127.0.0.1)**: The loopback interface, only accessible from your own machine\n- **0.0.0.0**: All network interfaces, making your server accessible on your LAN\n- **Your LAN IP (e.g., 192.168.1.x)**: Your private IP address on your local network\n\n## How Servers Listen\n\nA server \"listens\" on a **port** (like 3000, 8080, or 80). Think of ports as different doors into your computer:\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:3000 → Your machine, port 3000\nhttp://192.168.1.100:3000 → Same server, but accessible from LAN\n```\n\n## Private IP Ranges\n\nThese IP ranges are reserved for private networks (not routable on the internet):\n- **10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255**\n- **172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255**\n- **192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255**\n\nYour router assigns you one of these IPs via DHCP.",
