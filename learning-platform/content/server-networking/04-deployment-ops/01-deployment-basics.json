Blue-Green Deployment\n- Two identical environments (blue, green)\n- Deploy to inactive environment\n- Switch traffic instantly\n- Rollback is instant\n\n## 3. Rolling Deployment\n- Update servers one at a time\n- No downtime\n- Used with load balancers\n\n## CI/CD Pipeline\n```\nCode Push → Tests → Build → Deploy\n```\nTools: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins"}],
