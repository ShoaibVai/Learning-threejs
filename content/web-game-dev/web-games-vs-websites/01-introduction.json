It listens on a port, receives requests, and sends responses.\n\n### Web Apps vs Games\n**Web Apps** consist of event-driven UIs that react to user input and idle most of the time.\n\n**Games** run continuous loops, updating state every frame and rendering constantly. A game is a **real-time simulation**."
